One thing I'm proud of is the graph.html
My goal was fullfilling the needs of a music enthousiast and I feel like I have accomplished that.
The graphs are interactive and you are able to (intuivtively) find your way through your listening history.
I also made it easy to export your data and graphs, so if you want to explore more, you will have the data. 
And if you want to share or store the graphs locally, you are able to do so

I did not make any direct decissions design-wise. But indirectly my database structure largely impacted my design. 
I spent large amounts of time thinking and working through this, but I think the end result is suboptimal. 
Because of the slow nature of my program, I'm unable to start thinking about other features (like similar artists). 
In hindsight I should have sought more outside help. Because if the structure was a bit better I would be able to implement way more features.
